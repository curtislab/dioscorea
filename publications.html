<p>
  We will <FONT COLOR="DC1F1F">eventially provide a news feed</FONT> asociated with Dioscorea related new publications.
</p>

<p>
The most immediate source of Dioscorea references can be accessed by creating a FREE account on <FONT COLOR="14951F">no-cost web-based reference manager</font> <a href="https://www.mendeley.com/">MENDELEY</a> and then adding the "Dioscorea.org" Mendely Group.
Note that since this is a PUBLIC group, it is not possible to attach the PDF files; however, this allows anyone to gain access to the databased as well as the associated comments and curated citation metafile data. 
<b>Note that you can directly access the online MENDELEY database by placing the following URL into your browser </b> <a href="https://www.mendeley.com/groups/8056931/dioscorea-org/">www.mendeley.com/groups/8056931/dioscorea-org/ </a> 
</p>

If it is found useful, a periodic listing of references based on specific keywords wil be generated and posted for quick reference.  Suggested keywords are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>somatic embryogensis</li>
  <li>dormancy</li>
  <li>genomics AND bioinformatics</li>
</ul>

<p>
  We suggest that it would be very useful to be able to distribute URL references to <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">self-achirved submitted papers</span> as well.  
  The tools associated with understanding self-archive are explained at the web site <a href="">archive.it</a> which is a interface to simplify the <a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/">SHERPA/RoMEO database</a> of publishers' copyright and self-archiving policies.
