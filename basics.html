<p>Not to be confused with the dicot sweet potato (<i>Ipomoea batatas</i>) or yam bean (jicama or <i>Pachyrxhizus </i>), 
<i>Dioscorea</i>, commonly known as yam, is a genus of herbaceous, climbing, twining, perennial monocots—one of the oldest
amongst angiosperms. With over 600 species, it is generally characterized by its yam tubers (both below ground and aerial),
net-veined leaves, and small flowers, although they can be non-flowering in addition to dioecious, monoecious, or hermaphroditic.
<i>Dioscorea</i> is cultivated on 5 million hectares (12 million acres) of land, 94% of which is in West Africa (Tadele, 2009), 
and provides 200 calories to 300 million people daily. Dependent on species, <i>Disocorea</i> originated from either Asia or Africa,
but now grows all over the world in predominantly tropical regions. Calorically dense, yam tubers are an essential source of nutrition
in addition to having significant cultural roles, including use in traditional rites, religious festivals, and marital ceremonies. A 
cash crop, yams also play a significant role in providing livelihoods in developing countries; especially in the so-called Yam Belt, 
which consists of Nigeria, Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire, Benin, and Togo. Yam also  boast significant commercial potential for employ in 
industrial foods, nutraceuticals, and even medical applications (Eyitayo et al., 2010). Unfortunately, yam tubers face many

propagation methods. </p>
