<h1>Breeding Efficiency</h1>

<p>Breeding for higher yields, dwarfing, taste, shallow tuber formation, mechanization-ready varieties, climate change, nutrient-use
efficiency, disease, resistance, drought tolerance, and early harvest is a vital strategy for biodiversity, and thereby sustainable
yam cultivation. Unfortunately, yam suffers from low multiplication ratios, dormancy, and long growth periods, resulting in a 
painstakingly long breeding cycle, with reports of new varieties of water and white yam requiring 18-22 years. 
</p>

<h2>Dormancy</h2>
<p>An adaptive mechanism which enhances yam’s drought tolerance, dormancy is marked by starch reduction and minimum metabolic activity
including low respirations rates and activities of amylase, phosphorylase and G-6-PD. Typically, it lasts between 30-50 days, dependent
on species, or until sprouting begins—anywhere from 28 to 120 days after sprouting. On one hand dormancy represents a tremendous 
disadvantage, only allowing one generation to be bred annually; however, on the other hand, dormancy enabling long-term storage of yams
(<i>see</i> research on <a href="http://dioscorea.org/ongoing/storage.html">Storage/Shelf-life</a>). Understanding the mechanisms and 
building the capacity to control (i.e. either prolong or break) dormancy, therefore, is a significant area of research.</p>

<p>Thus far, it is evident that dormancy is largely endogenous, under tight genetic control and location specific. For example, 
planting of <i>D. alata>/i> over a period of seven months in Guadeloupe resulted in sprouting only between March and April. While 
bulbil-producing species <i>D. opposita</i> has induced sprouting via light and/or heat and correlated batatasin concentration to 
dormancy duration, this has not been replicated in more tropical species. Instead, most work on <i>D. alata, D. rotundata, 
D. esculenta, </i>and other tropical species has focused on prolonging shelf-life, for example with giberellic acid  (GA). In 
contrast, <i>in vitro<i> cultures, GA hurries initiation of microtubers (176 to 93 days), but they are small and shriveled. Some 
preliminary work has demonstrated the effectiveness of ethylene or its precursors (i.e. ethrel, 2-chloroethanol, and ethylene 
chlorohydrin) in breaking dormancy. Hamina et. al. (2013) also curbed dormancy with 30uM and 100 uM fluoridine treatments of long
dormancy varieties, <i>D. rotundata </i> var TDr 131 and <i>D. alata </i> var TDa 98/01166 , in coco coir medium.  [Craufurd]</p>

<h2>True Seed Breeding</h2>
<p>Most yams are cultivated from ‘seed’ yams, realistically small yam tubers or cuttings from larger (1kg+) ware (for consumption) 
yams. This represents a significant trade-off, however, requiring farmers to sacrifice 10-30% of yields for subsequent planting—not
to mention diminishing production of ware yams, which is a status symbol. Lack of synchronicity between fertility of male and female
plants and a higher ratio of male to female flowers contributes to the lack of true seed breeding. However, manual pollination, though
labor intensive, is possible and can be further enabled by <i>in vitro</i> pollination such that the 10-day ‘window’ of stigma 
receptivity can be prolonged and within 10-12 weeks, a seed matures. Kashihara et. al. (2013) demonstrated effectiveness of pollen
cryopreservation at -20°C after one year in four species and Daniel et. al. (2002) for 2 years at -80°C.</p>

<h2>Multiplication Ratios</h2>
<p>As long as breeding efficiency is limited by dormancy to one generation per year, cultivation of and research on yam is limited
principally by multiplication ratios. The traditional planting method of milking, whereby an intended ware yam is harvested prematurely
with the head being replanted to produce seed yam for the following year, provides 5-10 ware yams over the two-year (i.e year 1 for 
seed, year 2 to convert seed to ware) production. The Yam Minisett Technique (YMT) increased this multiplication ratio significantly
to 20-40 ware yams annually, but was not readily adopted since its introduction in the 1970s due to poor outreach programs and added
requirements of labor and infrastructure. A more recent YIIFSWA initiative to address these obstacles to adoption created the Adopted
Yam Minisett Technique (AYTM), which has been well-received to date. However, its advantages to adoption are offset by sacrifices in 
multiplication such that it produces 12-20 ware yams. The next evolution in macropropagation, vine-cutting provides up to a 30-fold 
increase in ware yam compared to YMT, in turn, reducing the time to rear a new variety from 10 years to 3.5 years (Lopez-Montes). 
Pelemo et. al. further detailed optimal vine cutting, stipulating that 11-15g minitubers were sufficient to produce ware yams (thus a 
multiplication ratio of 1:66-100) and that 5-11g vine cuttings could produce 100-300 seed tubers (thus an annual multiplication ratio
of 1:50-150). Tissue culture, particularly with induction of somatic embryogenesis, is also an avenue for increased multiplication 
ratios with the added benefit of definitively providing clean seed. See pages of
