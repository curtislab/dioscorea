  <h1>Yam Plant Tissue Culture Media</h1> 
   
  <p>Yam meristem culture will grow in most basic plant tissue culture with minimal hormones such as MS Salts or Gamborg B5 
  heterotrophic media.  As with any plant tissue culture media, growth is enhanced with the addition of plant growth regulations, and 
  invariably that enhbacement is species and even cultivar dependent.</p>
  
  <p>A basic MS Salts and vitamins meristem multiplication media for roughly bimonthly subculture is 
  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-MhYeI9HbLGcW1VQzVJaUNvSlU/view?usp=sharing">linked HERE</a> in MS Word format that can
  be downloaded and costomized for the sotck solutions used in your specific lab.</p>
  
  <p>A media for enhanced multiplication rates based on additional hormones is available ... LINK IT HERE</p>

  <h2>Understanding Media Components</h2>
  
  <p><b><span style="background-color: #00FF00">Inositol</span></b> provides for buffering of phosphate uptake allowing for phytic 
  acid formation (inositol hexaphosphate) thereby avoiding phoshpate toxicity.</p>
  
  <p><b><FONT COLOR="DC1F1F">Iron</FONT></b> is provied with EDTA because Fe+3 is difficult to metabolize and keep in solution without
  a chelator of this nature.  In fact the EDTA is provied in equimolar concentration with EDTA weather provided as as the sodium salt
  or the iron salt.</p>
   
   <p>The ration of <b><span style="background-color: #00FF00">ammonium to nitrate</span></b> facilitates pH contrl as ammonium 
   metabolsim results in proton secretion, where nitrate metabolism involves the similutaneous uptake of a proton.</p>
