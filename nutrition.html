    <h1>Nutrition</h1>
    
    <p><i>Dioscorea</i> is a major food staple throughout Africa and tropical regions with reports of providing at least 200 dietary 
    calories to 300 million people in the tropics and up to 552 calories daily in Cote d’Ivoire. Of the 600+ varieties of yam, however,
    there is only a comparative handful (50-60) that are cultivated or gathered for food or pharmaceutical purposes. The most 
    significant food crops economically are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li><i>D. rotundata</i>: white Guinea yam</li>
      <li><i>D. alata</i>: water yam, winged yam or greater yam</li>
      <li><i>D. cayenensis</i>: yellow yam or yellow Guinea yam</li>
      <li><i>D. esculenta</i>: lesser yam, potato yam or Chinese yam</li>
      <li><i>D. dumetorum</i>: bitter yam or trifoliolate yam</li>
      <li><i>D. bulbifera</i>: aerial potato yam</li>
      <li><i>D. trifida</i>: cush-cush yam</li>
      <li><i>D. opposita</i>: also known as <i>D. japonicum</i>, cinnamon yam</li>
    </ul>
  Other notable sought-after species of wild yam include <i>D. preanhensilis, D. abyssinca, D. burkilliana, D. mangenotiana,</i> 
  and <i>D. togoensis</i>. Beyond being calorically dense, yams are a source of Vitamins C and B6, potassium, iron, and manganese 
  with low levels of salt and saturated fats (see 
  <a href= "http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/3266?fgcd=&manu=&lfacet=&format=Full&count=&max=35&offset=&sort=&qlookup=11601">USDA National Nutrient Database Record for <i>Dioscorea</i></a>),
  thereby lending itself to protecting against malnourishment-related diseases such as Kwashiorkor, goiter, dwarfism, and Konzo 
  (spastic paralysis). Compared to cassava, yam also has an eight-fold supply of protein as well as not threatening cyanide poisoning
  if cooked improperly. Unfortunately, besides threatening yields, fungal pathogens also reduce yams’ nutritional value, particularly
  <i>Asperigillus niger</i> and <i>Botriodiploida theobromae</i> which are the most destructive. With only ~10% of yam varieties being
  edible, D. alata, D. cayensis, and D. rotundata are the most frequently consumed varieties; however, <i>D. esculenta</i> has been
  reported as the most nutritious. Meanwhile, <i>D. dumetorum</i>, a bitter yam, is a ‘famine crop’ that is eaten in times of food
  scarcity and requires soaking and cooking before eating. </p>

  <h2>Food Applications</h2>
    <p>Like other starchy tubers, yams can be boiled, baked, roasted, mashed, fried, etc. Classic dishes with yam include amala, 
    foutou, fufu, and pounded yam (see recipes). Paulus et. al. (2013) also reported the use of shoots and leaves for consumption. 
    Yams are also frequently made into flours or elubo, a slightly fermented flour for longer storage. Traditionally, varieties of 
    ‘harder’ yams that are more resistant to pests and higher yielding maintain characteristics good for flours while softer yams 
    are more preferred for their sweetness. While yam flours alone cannot make glutenous breads, they can be substituted at up tp 
    30% in wheat flours to still meet customer satisfaction. Significantly, yam flours have a low glycemic content (for preventing 
    diabetes). <i>Dioscorea</i> also responds favorably to acid modification which makes it conducive to large-scale food applications.
    Various species also boast properties conducive to large-scale food applications including <i> D. alata</i> for ready-to-eat snacks, 
    <i>D. dumetorum </i> for paste and infant formulas, and <i>D. cayensis</i> and <i>D. rotundata</i> for higher elasticity products.</p>
